The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users
have been alive. It has survived because it's a powerful tool that
allows users to perform complex and powerful tasks, often with just
 a few keystrokes or lines of code. It helps users automate repetitive
 tasks and easily combine smaller tasks into larger, more powerful workflows.

Use of the shell is fundamental to a wide range of advanced computing
tasks, including high-performance computing. These lessons will introduce
you to this powerful tool.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson guides you through the basics of file systems and the
> shell. If you have stored files on a computer at all and recognize
> the word "file" and either "directory" or "folder" (two common words
> for the same thing), you're ready for this lesson.
>
> If you're already comfortable manipulating files and directories,
> searching for files with `grep` and `find`, and writing simple loops
> and scripts, you probably want to explore the next lesson:
> [shell-extras](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/shell-extras/).
