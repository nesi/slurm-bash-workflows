## Scheduling

When you are running commands in your terminal, you are interacting with the _Login Node_, a shared space intended for interactive use.
You can run bash scripts here e.g `bash myScript.sh`, and it will run right away however it will be running on local resources.


| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Command | Type | Blocking | Example | Usage
| `bash` | Current enviroment | Yes |
| `sbatch` | Scheduled | No | 
| `srun` | Scheduled | Yes |
| `sbatch --wrap` | Sceduled | No |


## JupyterHub
> If you are using JupyterHub, you will _not_ be on the login node, however for the purposes of this lesson the same contstrains apply.
